The loadtest directory contains a couple scripts to generate and load
random data to test the database and backend (maybe also parts of the
frontend) with a reasonable amount of data.

Source Data
===========

To gather a list of (hopefully) valid URLs, testcrap.py was used - a
public domain script that repeatedly queries randomwebsite.com. It
generated urls.txt. A list of random names was collected manually from
a random name generation website (emitting 100 names at a time).

Data Load Script
================

populate.py expects an empty database, initialized with just the bare
structure, functions and static-data of the MON project. It reads URLs
from urls.txt and user names from randomnames.txt. Assignment between
users and URLs is entirely randomized, but tries to mimic an
exponential distribution. Depending on how many URLs a user gets some
url_groups get created as well.

No real content is being fetched from the web, but artificial historic
data gets generated for each job (documents and notifications).

With the default settings and a local database, the script runs for
approximately 30 minutes to load the database.
